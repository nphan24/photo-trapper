# Photo-Trapper

This app was our final assessment for mod 4 at Turing. It was built in five hours. We had to build a database and a front-end. The app allows the user to save a name and image. It then displays the name and image on the screen with the ability to delete each. The server had to be fully tested with mocha, chai, and chai-http. 

[This app is live on Heroku](https://phan-photo-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

### Tech Stack 

- jQuery
- Postgresql
